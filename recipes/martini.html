        <h2>Description</h2>
            <p>A vodka martini is a classic cocktail and easy to make with just 
            vodka, dry vermouth, and ice. Serve in a chilled martini glass and garnish 
            with olives or a lemon twist for an elegant cocktail at home.</p>
        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>3 fluid ounces vodka</li>
                <li>1 fluid ounce dry Vermouth</li>
                <li>3 small oives</li>
                <li>1 cup ice cubes</li>
            </ul>
        <h3>Steps:</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Combine the vodka and dry vermouth in a mixing glass with ice.</li>
                <li>Stir until chilled, then strain into a chilled martini glass. </li>
                <li>Top the cocktail with as many olives as you like (threaded onto a toothpick). </li>
            </ol>
        <h4>Tips:</h4>
            <p>A dirty martini means the cocktail contains olive brine 
                (in addition to the olive garnish). 
                This martini is not dirty, but you could easily make it dirty 
                by adding half an ounce of olive brine. </p>
