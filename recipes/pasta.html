            <p>I combined several different recipes to create 
                this shrimp and mushroom Alfredo pasta dish — it's definitely a winner. 
                Garnish with chopped parsley.</p>
        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>1 (16 ounce) box dry fettuccine pasta</li>
                <li>1 ¼ cups butter, divided</li>
                <li>1 pint heavy whipping cream</li>
                <li>¾ cup grated Romano cheese</li>
                <li>½ cup grated Parmesan cheese</li>
                <li>3 cloves crushed, divided garlic</li>
                <li>salt and ground black pepper</li>
                <li>2 tablespoons olive oil</li>
                <li>1 large onion, chopped</li>
                <li>8 ounces diced mushrooms</li>
                <li>8 ounces of shrimp; deveined and tails removed</li>
            </ul>
        <h3>Steps:</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>
                    <p>Fill a large pot with lightly salted water and bring to a rolling boil over medium heat. <br>
                        Stir in fettuccine, return to a boil, and cook until tender yet firm to the bite, about 8 minutes. <br>
                        Drain and keep warm.</p> </li>
                <li>
                    <p>While the fettuccine is cooking, heat 1 cup butter and cream in a large saucepan over medium heat. <br>
                        When butter melts, add Romano, Parmesan, 1/3 of the garlic, salt, and pepper; 
                        cook and stir until cheese melts and sauce thickens, about 5 minutes. <br> Remove from the heat.</p> </li>
                <li>
                    <p>At the same time, heat remaining 1/4 cup butter and olive oil in another saucepan over medium heat. <br>
                    When butter melts, add onion; cook and stir until softened and translucent, 2 to 3 minutes. <br>
                    Stir in mushrooms and remaining garlic; 
                    increase the heat to medium-high and cook until mushrooms are soft, about 2 minutes. 
                    Add shrimp and cook until bright pink on the outside and opaque in the center, 1 to 2 minutes.</p></li>
                <li>
                    <p>Fold shrimp mixture into sauce. Add drained fettuccine and toss to coat. </p>
                </li>
            </ol>
